# lessdefaults

Lending Club (http://www.lendingclub.com) makes data available on all their loans.

Can we use that data to identify loans at higher risk of default than average?
Especiall, can we identify any filterable characteristics of those loans?

If we can identify something to filter to reduce the chance of default,
then our returns will improve.
